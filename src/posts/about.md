I'm a data analytics and system engineering professional with Crohn's disease. I am starting this website to explore my interests, curate resources, and learn about the connections between the gut, mental health, and our food systems. 

I've always loved food. As someone who developed IBD in their late 20's, it was a difficult transition when my body wouldn't allow me to enjoy the foods I love. This caused me to get really into home cooking, and I hope to inspire others to find creative ways to enjoy food within the constraints of a restrictive diet.
