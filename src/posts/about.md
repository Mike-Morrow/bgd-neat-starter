Better Gut Digest explains complex gut topics, interviews experts, and shares easy-to-implement home cooking techniques for people with GI issues.

### There’s a galaxy inside each of us

The Milky Way contains approximately 100 billion stars. This number pales in comparison to the 40 trillion bacteria in our gut1. Living inside our body’s plumbing, these squatters may help us, hurt us, or leave us alone. Between our microbiome, genes, lifestyle, and other environmental factors, everybody’s gut is complex and unique.

### I didn’t always spend this much time thinking about the gut

Around 2019, my body gradually began rejecting the foods I used to love. Gone were the days of Chipotle and Panang Curry takeout. My diet became very restrictive out of necessity.

Fast forward a few years, and after dropping ~50 pounds in a few short months (not the good kind of weight loss), I finally got a proper GI workup2 and was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s is an autoimmune condition causing inflammation and ulceration of the gut, as well as thickening of the intestinal walls. Diseases, like Crohn’s, Colitis, and Celiac are on the rise3, and about 1 in 10 adults in the US report having IBS4. I am very thankful for caring physicians and modern medicine5 because today, I can say the inflammation is under control, my weight’s back, and my diet is less restrictive. Unfortunately there are many others suffering, banging their head against the wall with food journals, trying to find answers and relief. They find themselves undiagnosed, mis-diagnosed, or their condition can’t be explained (which can be extra unnerving). The information online about GI issues and food is — to put in kindly — a cluster. I hope to cut through the noise with no non-sense content that educates and inspires but doesn’t claim to have all the answers. One of the silver linings of getting Crohn’s is I have fallen in love with cooking at home. I became singularly focused on making food taste good while still agreeing with my body. Although, I am able to eat out again without as many issues, I prefer home cooking where I can control what goes into a dish — and it’s fun! Everyone has different triggers and sensitivities, so my aim is not to give you recipes or diets, but to provide frameworks and techniques that have helped me enjoy the habit of home cooking. If you or a loved one is suffering from a misbehaved gut, I invite you on this journey to understand this complex organ system and navigate the roadblocks it presents. I’m confident your gut will thank you.
