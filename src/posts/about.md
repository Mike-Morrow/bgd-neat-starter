My name's Mike Morrow, and I created Better Gut Digest to help people understand and improve their gut problems. 

Around 2019, my body gradually began rejecting the foods I used to love. Gone were the days of Chipotle and Panang Curry takeout. My diet became very restrictive out of necessity.

Fast forward a few years, and after dropping ~50 pounds in a few short months (not the good kind of weight loss), I finally got a proper GI workup and was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. 

I am very thankful for caring physicians and modern medicine because today, I can say the inflammation is under control, my weight’s back, and my diet is less restrictive.

Unfortunately there are many others suffering, banging their head against the wall with food journals, trying to find answers and relief. They find themselves undiagnosed, mis-diagnosed, or their condition can’t be explained (which can be extra unnerving).

The information online about GI issues and food is — to put in kindly — a cluster. I hope to cut through the noise with no non-sense content that educates and inspires but doesn’t claim to have all the answers.

One of the silver linings of getting Crohn’s is I have fallen in love with cooking at home. I became singularly focused on making food taste good while still agreeing with my body. Although, I am able to eat out again without as many issues, I prefer home cooking where I can control what goes into a dish — and it’s fun!

As a system engineer by trade, I'm trying to learn about all the components affecting gut health including: 
- food production
- diet and lifestyle
- gut flora
- disease
- mental health
- and more...

If you or a loved one is suffering from a misbehaved gut, I invite you on this journey of learning. I’m confident your gut will thank you.
