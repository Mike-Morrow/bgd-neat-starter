I’m using the Zojirushi NS-TSC10 5-1/2-Cup (Uncooked) Micom Rice Cooker and Warmer, 1\.0-Liter.

Zojirushis are designed for perfect jasmine rice, so adapting them to dishes like Mujadarra may take trial and error. The following recipe works for me — I am using white jasmine rice, brown lentils, and half a yellow onion. If you add more onion or your lentils absorb more or less water than mine, you may need to tweak.


> Quick note to my fodmap friends: this dish won’t really work for you as-is. But you could try subbing onion for a friendlier aromatic, along with onion-infused oil. I don’t soak the lentils here, but you could do that. Instead of topping with fried onions at the end, you could crumble up some corn chips.

If this is a main course, it’ll serve 3 give or take. 


```
Parcook 1 cup brown lentils (most common ones in US grocery stores) for 20 min on steam mode with water filled up to the same line you’d use for 1 cup of rice
```
While the lentils are parcooking —


```
Sauté or airfry 1/2 thinly sliced onion
```
When the 20 minutes is up —


```
Drain (and rinse if you want) lentils
```
With your lentils in the strainer…


```
Rinse 1 cup of rice in the rice cooker inner pot
```
The inner pot should now have only your drained, rinsed rice.


```
Add water to the 1 cup of rice line. Then add in your strained lentils and the onions (make sure to include the excess onion oil). With all those ingredients combined, add 1/2 cup of water to rice cooker to make sure things don’t dry up (because your lentils will likely absorb more water)
```
With all your ingredients and water in the inner pot…


```
Select white rice mode and hover over the rice cooker impatiently for 60 minutes until you hear it sing its melody
```
And lastly the required optional steps —


```
Add salt to taste, good olive oil, lemon or vinegar, chopped herbs, or whatever you want — it’s typical to top with reserved fried onions
```
