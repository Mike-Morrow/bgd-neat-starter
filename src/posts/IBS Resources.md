We have plans to have discussions and guest posts from GI doctors that are coming soon! 

IBS is a tricky condition because there is no universally agreed upon diagnosis and screening method. As the name suggests - Irritable Bowel *Syndrome* -- doctors can recognize symptom patterns but not an underlying disease. This lack of clarity can be frustrating and invalidating for patients. IBS is usually categorized into IBS-C (for constipation) and IBS-D (for diarrhea). 

There are 3 areas that show promise for improving IBS: 
1) Getting adequate fiber in your diet (as well as the right kind of fiber)
2) Identifying possible trigger foods -- Monash University's FODMAP approach is designed to help you figure out potential problem areas. 
3) Addressing anxiety and other mental health challenges

We have plans to do a deep dive series into FODMAPs and the gut-brain connection, so stay tuned!
