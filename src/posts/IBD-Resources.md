We have plans to have discussions and guest posts from GI doctors that are coming soon! 

IBD (i.e. Crohn's and Colitis) are serious conditions that a GI doctor diagnoses from running a series of tests/exams. 

Certain tests, like blood tests, can indicate that you have inflammation. But those alone cannot diagnose IBD. Imaging of the gut (usually via colonoscopy) is the gold standard for diagnosis. 

If you have been diagnosed, I highly recommend the [Crohn's and Colitis Foundation's resources](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/).

They have support groups, educational resources, recipes and diets, and more.
